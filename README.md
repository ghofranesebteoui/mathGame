In this project, we will create a program to test our understanding of the BODMAS arithmetic rule:

B: Brackets first
O: Orders (e.g., Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
DM: Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)
AS: Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)
Our program will randomly generate an arithmetic question that we need to answer. If we provide an incorrect answer, the program will display the correct one and ask if we would like to try another question.

Additionally, the program will keep track of our attempts and record them in an external text file. After each question, we can type “-1” to exit the program.
